## Aliases

###Â setup_aws_credentials
It's used to set aws credentials on your shell environment including temporary access token (also used with MFA authentications)

```
$ setup_aws_credentials [YOUR_AWS_PROFILE]
```

### git-aws
It's a wrapper around git command. It overrides the default git credentials helper to use the AWS IAM specific credentials only for that command.

```
$ git-aws [AWS_PROFILE] [[GIT_COMMANDS] ...]
```
